  * CDC change feeds and Secondary Indexes are displayed in Database scheme hierarchy as separate objects.
  * Visualization of query explain plan was completely redesigned.
  * Storage groups with problems are now more visible.
  * Various optimizations based on UX assessment

* Query Processing:
  * Added Query Processor 2.0 â€” a brand new version of execution engine for OLTP-queries with significant improvements comparing to previous one.
  * Improved performance: up to 10% better read throughout, up to 60% better write throughput.
  * A feature for NOT NULL constraint for Primary Key has been added. Can be set up at table creation stage only.
  * Added support of online secondary index rename without stopping the service.
  * Improved query explain representation now includes graph for physical operators.

* Core:

  * Added TTL support for tables with async secondary indexes.
  * Added option to compress data during export to S3.
  * Added initial version of audit log for DDL statements.
